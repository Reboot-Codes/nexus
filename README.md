# Nexus

Security focused superglue for multi-package software packages.

**NOTE: Nexus is currently known as EvtBuzz and Arbiter within [CLOVER](http://clover.reboot-codes.com/docs/components/clover-hub/server/evtbuzz/intro). Migration is currently in progress!** Nexus is designed to combine functionality from projects like RabbitMQ, MQTT, and PM2 while enforcing a security-first permission model. Nexus can be embedded in rust-based, and rust-compatible software (via an FFI), or can be run seperately for scaling and/or segmentation. 

Nexus is designed to be primarilly used by [CLOVER](https://clover.reboot-codes.com) and [JAMES/FIDO](https://james-fido.reboot-codes.com), but is also designed to be used in other projects as well as it is documented as it's developed.
